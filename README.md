# Calzone


A direct to framebuffer calendar application for the Raspberry Pi Zero


There are two components to calzone. The first is the ui submodule, developed by me, and displays the calendar on the monitor connected to the Pi Zero. The second component is the server submodule, developed by a friend of mine, and is a webserver you can use to add and remove events from the calendar
